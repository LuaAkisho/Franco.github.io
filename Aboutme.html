		            <p>Hi! The names Brian, Brian John Franco. My friends call me Bry and Brian so  stick with it and never use my second name! Cause never in a hundred years would I let anyone call me by my second name, mainly because John are typically known as play boys. Other than that Im a pretty chill guy! I am a Computer Science major in STI West Negros University and a proud member of the Programmers Guild Organisation, so if you have any questions feel free to ask, I wont bite :) .</p>

		            <p>My hobbies include gaming, The main games that Im into or investing time in are League of Legends WildRift, Wethering Waves and Honkai StarRail. Apart from that, I also go to the gym from time to time investing in myself and my health. And recently I have taken in a new hobby which is mastering yoyo tricks, no particular reason just thatit seems like a cool trick and skill you can brag about or show to your friends.</p>

		            <p>Hopefully in the future I get to continue my hobby as a music producer, I have been in hiatus for 2 years due to academics, but when I finish college I will find and lend some time into creating music for the whole world to enjoy.</p>
